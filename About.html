<p> I'm Nicos Gabriel de Guia, a student of Adamson University. My age is 19 years old, I was <br> born on the 26th of August 2002. I currently live at Sampaloc, Manila. I easily enjoy <br>interesting things like painting and drawing, I also like having fun with my friends playing <br> online games and I am really interested in Basketball. Since the virus started spreading <br> I haven't played basketball since then. I'm locked up in my room staring at my computer <br> all the time. I play online games to help me get out of boredom. I want to improve my coding <br> skills and learn other languages, im striving for my goals and im looking forward to graduate <br> as an Information Technology Student.
